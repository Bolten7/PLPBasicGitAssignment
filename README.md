Here are the steps to work.

*I created my repository titled 'PLPBasicGitAssignment' since i already had a Github account
*I used VS code for the code editor choice.
*Created a folder on my local disk as 'PLPBasicGitAssignment' and opened on VS code.
*then opened terminal on VS code to work with folder created.

next step
*initialize the new git repository
therefore git init

*git remote add origin https://github.com/Bolten7/PLPBasicGitAssignment
To link the local repository to github repository

*I created a text file within my local folder in VS code titiled "hello.txt" with a simple text 'Hello, Git!'

*git add hello.txt

*git commit -m
to commit the changes made

*git push -u origin master
This is to push to Github.
